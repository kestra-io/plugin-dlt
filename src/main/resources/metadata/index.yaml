description: "Tasks that run dlt (data load tool) pipelines and CLI commands to move data into analytics destinations."
body: "Use these tasks to execute dlt workloads either from inline Python (`Run`) or through non-interactive CLI commands (`CLI`). Provide a Python `script` or list of `commands`, set `beforeCommands` to install dependencies, and adjust the default `ghcr.io/kestra-io/dlt` image when you need custom environments; the CLI task also auto-adds `--non-interactive` and installs `requirements.txt` after `dlt init`."
